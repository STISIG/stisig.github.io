2021-01-01 // Getting Header Images Ready
:	Thanks to Google Image Search's ability to sort for Creative Commons images, there are a variety of images i've been able to repurpose for the page. I've been trying to stick with a theme of EOC images as much of where we'll be focusing is on the EOC with EM more generally in the background. Also edited and finished up another blog entry to speculate and seed discussion for future meetings. 

2020-12-15 // Initial Content
:	A lot of the page is starting to feel like it belongs within the SIG. I wrote a couple placeholder / provocations / speculations for the blog. Over the next month or two, i'll start adding work that various members of the SIG have done. I think official launch will be at the end of January. 


2020-12-12 // Webpage
:   One of the things that I really wanted to do was to harness the ease of Jekyll-based webpages for this project. The `Feeling Responsive` theme provided a fantastic way to make everything look nice while offering a way for anyone to offer blog entries, thoughts, or alterations to the site as a whole. 

2020-12-10 // Initiation
:   Began to consolidate various resources into what would become an STISIG Github Account. Some things I wanted to do with this is to provide a home for the work everyone is doing and combine it with the concept of technology within EM. As a repository and blog for news about technology across the domain, I felt like it would help me (Nick) organize my work while also providing a useful resource for anyone interested in the topic.
