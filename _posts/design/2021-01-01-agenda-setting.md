As a new tenure track researcher in the information science realm, I am supposed to be pushing the bleeding edge of discovery, pushing technology further, and relentlessly seeking "progress." I find; however, that I am not concerned with pushing the edge insomuch as I am interested in broadening, strengthening, and better integrating technology into human cultures. Since my research domain is human-computer interaction specifically and emergency management (EM) generally, I am interested in how to undo, approach, or work in a domain marked not by its technical prowess, but by its ability to get things done when nothing works. It is a design space that many of my colleagues ignore (not usually on purpose) for a very specific reason.

A good example of this is looking to how technology might shape the future of EM. I gave a talk in 2019 in Nottingham about what a fictional world of Search and Rescue might look like should technology be integrated successfully with Search and Rescue (SAR) operations (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/8ktgumq2ya66y9y/LaLone%20-%20Future%20of%20SAR.pptx?dl=0" target=_blank>PPT file</a> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/4u40ed7fcxwup6i/LaLone%20-%20Halfway%20to%20the%20Future%20-%20Vision%20of%20Search%20and%20Rescue.pdf?dl=0" target=_blank>PDF</a>. The above image is from that talk. During that slide, I outlined the design space for technologists who want to work within an EM environment. Imagine a design space where everything is broken. Electricity may be in and out, connectivity is non-existent, and any stability that can be expected in a 'normal' environment is completely gone. 

And that is at ground zero. 

For base camps, ICPs, or EOCs, the technical needs for these centers varies wildly but also needs to be compatible, fast, low power, simple to use, and as unbreakable as possible. If we attach these needs to current technology, literally nothing can be integrated, at all. Current technology, especially bleeding edge technology, is not compatible with unstable environments like those of a large-scale disaster. And this is a difficult issue to discuss because if it is not compatible with unstable environments, then what exactly is technology doing for society as a whole?

It is no controversy to say that current technology (computers, mobile devices, and everything in between) cannot live within the world that created it. Current technology's planned obsolescence is incompatible with long term cultural resilience, city planning, disaster planning, and being useful inside of theaters of operations where EM is attempting to re-establish stability when it has failed.

And if technology is not compatible with the resilience of a municipality, organization, building, or business, then how can we strive to create an EM that is "technically literate?"

This term, "technical literacy" or "computational literacy" or "data literacy" all refers to this belief that the ability to use, understand, evaluate, create, and apply things from technology is similar to that of writing and reading. However, the nature of this concept is slightly more complicated. Writing and reading is a skill that can be adapted for any situation. It allows us to enhance resilience because it fosters training, learning, calling for help, and other ways we use those things. We need literacy for other kinds of things, even computers. 

Yet, if technology is not able to be used in this way (and yes, there are numerous examples of *unanticipated use* with *unanticipated* being the operative term) then how can we call to the concept of literacy as anything more than an area wherein a person can use a computer within a stable environment and understand what is happening within the device and before being shown what is on a screen.

For technology to be integrated with EM, we need to not only move away from the concept of literacy, but push back on the way that technology itself is created, meant to be used, sold, and designed. 

From that perspective, there are a lot of questions to think about when considering "how" to integrate tech with EM. The most important of those is, "What would it even do?" Below is a collection of XX questions that should be answered as we strive to integrate tech with EM.

Base Operations
	1. How do you handle EOC software? -- At current, these are all closed source and private.
	2. 

Data needs? Data pipelines? Information management/warehousing/provenance? Version control? Platform compatibility? Permissions?
Given the posts I often see here, how can you ensure that the information you’re seeing is valid and vetted properly within this automated space when it disagrees with the misinformation the person looking at it believes in with their personal feed and psychologically have no tools to disagree with?

How can you tie Incident Management and Emergency Management information systems together if they’re separated where you are?

How can you scale up, incorporate national information systems, journalist systems, crowdsourcing, and crowd-based platforms that have far more resources than you? Social media EM platforms and data feeds. Can you tie in messaging apps for these platforms into your eco-system easily?

How do you ensure you can keep what you might need secure?
What would a future that is successful with computational techniques look like in terms of representation because I imagine well over half of existing personnel would need to be replaced with folx who have the training to deal with these things.

And as of now, personnel who would work in positions with this much tech wouldn’t work in a low-paying sector like this.
