Way more than tech proficiency, really.

How do you handle EOC software though? Data needs? Data pipelines? Information management/warehousing/provenance? Version control? Platform compatibility? Permissions?
Given the posts I often see here, how can you ensure that the information you’re seeing is valid and vetted properly within this automated space when it disagrees with the misinformation the person looking at it believes in with their personal feed and psychologically have no tools to disagree with?

How can you tie Incident Management and Emergency Management information systems together if they’re separated where you are?

How can you scale up, incorporate national information systems, journalist systems, crowdsourcing, and crowd-based platforms that have far more resources than you? Social media EM platforms and data feeds. Can you tie in messaging apps for these platforms into your eco-system easily?

How do you ensure you can keep what you might need secure?
What would a future that is successful with computational techniques look like in terms of representation because I imagine well over half of existing personnel would need to be replaced with folx who have the training to deal with these things.

And as of now, personnel who would work in positions with this much tech wouldn’t work in a low-paying sector like this.
