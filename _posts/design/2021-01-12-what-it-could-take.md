The gap between practice and academia is even wider when considering technology academia and EM practice. Software that doesn't meet basic needs, doesn't really do what is needed for practice, and is not customizable by practitioners. Much of this is the result of technology academia having insufficient access or having not done its due dilligence to learn how to best design for the space they are designing for. Articles like this one are an attempt to understand the basic patterns of practice in EM, in this case, Search and Rescue operations.
