Crisis Informatics is important because the use of technology, especially mobile technology, has increased exponentially in the past 20 years. Along with the proliferation and adoption of these devices, different modes of communication have not only become more prevalent, but in many cases almost completely replaced them. Emergency management, on the other hand, still relies on radios, telephone lines, and bare minimum technology. There are important reasons for this in that you cannot know what infrastructure will be available at ground zero / base camp, but outside of those areas, there is still potential for technology integration. 

Yet, there is vast potential within these forms of communication for EM in general; however, the way to make them useful is still mostly unknown and is currently contained in techniques so fragile as to be unuseful. Despite this, work continues in trying to find ways to make social media, messaging, texting, and other forms of electronic communication useful. 

Articles like, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10447318.2018.1427832" target=_blank>Social Media in Crisis Management: An Evaluation and Analysis of Crisis Informatics Research"</a> provide useful summaries of how those responsible for the creation and adoption of these devices, applications, and new modes of communication, are laboring to find ways to integrate them with the practice of emergency management. 

This piece, from Christian Reuter and ‪Marc-André Kaufhold‬ at Technische Universität Darmstadt as well as Amanda Hughes at Utah State University, provides an evaluation of the ways that crisis informatics researchers have attempted to make sense of social media data for emergency management, their successes, and what challenges remain for this research. 

The approach this article provides is relatively straight forward. It starts by making the case that social media is increasingly important for "how people respond to and communicate around these
world-wide disasters." It is important to note here that much of this work is typically ad hoc and driven by emergent groups.
