As a new PhD student, I was introduced to the domain of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/crisisinformatics" target=_blank>Crisis Informatics</a> or the study of information communication technology use during disaster. I found that trying to make sense of internet-based communication was nothing short of impossible.

The use of technology, especially mobile technology, has increased exponentially in the past 20 years. Along with the proliferation and adoption of these devices, different modes of communication have not only become more prevalent, but in many cases almost completely replaced them. 

Articles like, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10447318.2018.1427832" target=_blank>Social Media in Crisis Management: An Evaluation and Analysis of Crisis Informatics Research"</a> provide useful summaries of how those responsible for the creation and adoption of these devices, applications, and new modes of communication, are laboring to find ways to integrate them with the practice of emergency management. 

This piece, from Christian Reuter and ‪Marc-André Kaufhold‬ at Technische Universität Darmstadt as well as Amanda Hughes at Utah State University, provides an evaluation of the ways that crisis informatics researchers have attempted to make sense of social media data for emergency management, their successes, and what challenges remain for this research.
