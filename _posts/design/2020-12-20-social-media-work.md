As a new PhD student, I was introduced to the domain of <a href="https://tinyurl.com/crisisinformatics" target=_blank>Crisis Informatics</a> or the study of information communication technology use during disaster. As I learned more about the techniques and potential of this space, I found that much of the tension of computer science's future was contained within trying to make sense of posts on social media and other forms of internet-based communication. But there's so much more to do.
